# top-scratchers
This is a JSON of all the scratchers in order of from highest to lowest. Don't see your name? Feel free to open a Pull Request with it added, and I'll be happy to merge it :)

How is this list being made? I'm running a script that will make this list more and more accurate over time.

This took a lot of work to make. I can't really stop you from stealing this, but if you plan to use it in any of your projects, I'd appreciate if you could let me know on my Scratch profile (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PackersRuleGoPack) or open up an issue here so we can talk about the credit being given.
